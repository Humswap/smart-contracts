### Auction (Live on TestNet) - [[Dora Link]](https://dora.coz.io/contract/neo3/mainnet/0x07d6901d7cbdd7905b17465fd768104b6cefe422)
Our auction contract facilitates the transfer of NFTs via auction format. When a user sends an amount greater than the previous bid, the contract will automatically refund the previous highest bidder. In it's current state, loading NFTs and ending auctions are both manual processes. We plan on automating this, and also allowing for anyone to use the auction contract to auction any NFT of their choosing. 

**⭐ Roadmap Item**: Automate NFT and Auction starting/ending ; Allow for anyone to use Auction contract to sell NFTs

### PitaToss (Live on TestNet) - [[Dora Link]](https://dora.coz.io/contract/neo3/mainnet/0xf323d5ece33b8b969f57777d3e5dcb25840d53d8)
Send some GAS to toss a Pita, if you land in hummus you win a rare NFT! It costs 0.1 GAS to toss a PITA, if you don't land in hummus, the PITA that landed on the floor is yours! This is the beginning of introducing games to our ecosystem, and when a user tosses a pita, we derive a pseudo random number to determine if they win. The user will always win something. Chances of winning the rare NFT are configurable, our default setting is a 1% chance as the random number range is 0-99 with 99 being the winning number.

**⭐ Roadmap Item**: We plan on having multiple rare types of NFTs winnable in one toss. This would be variable percentage rates for each NFT. Additionally, we plan to add more user interaction

<br>

### Purchase (Live on TestNet) - [[Dora Link]](https://dora.coz.io/contract/neo3/mainnet/0x6ad5f385f109dcfe1af4952921188ed0356b6b9b)

Our purchase contract allows for the purchase of tokens and NFTs with other tokens or NFTs. Beet Hummus will be our first launched product on this marketplace, and will cost 1,000 PITA

**⭐ Roadmap Item**: Allow any user to place an item for purchase via our contract.
